(ns isaac.comm.imessage.handbook-chapter-spec
  "Lint for isaac-imessage's own handbook chapter (isaac-6nfg): every backtick
   `config:<path>` reference must resolve against the composed config schema,
   and every `isaac <command>` invocation must name a registered top-level
   CLI command. See the convention comment at the top of the chapter file
   itself, and isaac.foundation.handbook-chapter-spec for the pattern this
   follows.

   isaac-imessage's own manifest does not declare :builtin? true (unlike
   isaac-gchat/isaac-hooks/isaac-episodes), and this bean intentionally does
   not add it — :builtin? also controls eager module loading
   (isaac.module.lifecycle/eager-load?), which is a behavior change outside
   this bean's ungated scope. Instead this spec builds its own module index
   by reading the raw isaac-manifest.edn classpath resource directly and
   merging it into isaac.module.discovery/builtin-index — enough for
   schema-compose to see this module's :extra-schema/:send-schema
   contributions, without touching how the module loads at runtime."
