# gherclj Step Implementation

## When This Skill Applies

Use this skill whenever you are implementing step definitions for `.feature` files in a gherclj project. This includes any bead that references a feature file or involves writing `defgiven`, `defwhen`, or `defthen` steps and their helper functions.

## Feature Contract Integrity

Approved `.feature` files are behavioral contracts.

- Do NOT semantically weaken, reinterpret, or rewrite approved scenarios without user approval.
- Clarifying wording changes are fine only when they preserve the approved behavior exactly.
- If implementation and approved feature text diverge, stop and raise the mismatch instead of changing the scenario to fit partial implementation.

## Step Definitions Must Exercise Real Behavior

Helper functions should test real product behavior through real code paths where feasible.

- Prefer calling production entry points, public APIs, application services, or other real seams the product already exposes.
- If a scenario needs a seam, prefer a real public seam or an explicitly approved test hook.
- Do not move product logic into helper functions just because the implementation is missing.

## Forbidden Acceptance-Test Shortcuts

- Do NOT inject unimplemented product behavior directly in helper functions just to make scenarios pass.
- Do NOT add acceptance-test-only shims that simulate promised behavior the product does not actually implement.
- Passing feature scenarios must reflect actual implemented behavior, not test-only shortcuts.
- A bead is not complete if the feature passes only because the helpers fake missing behavior.

## Architecture: Steps and Helpers

Step definitions are pure routing — a phrase mapped to a helper function reference. All logic lives in a separate helpers namespace.

```
spec/<app>/features/steps/<feature>.clj   — phrase → helper routing
spec/<app>/features/helpers/<feature>.clj — actual test logic
```

### Steps file — pure routing

Use `helper!` to declare the helper namespace, then route each phrase to its helper function:

```clojure
(ns myapp.features.steps.auth
  (:require [gherclj.core :refer [defgiven defwhen defthen helper!]]
            [myapp.features.helpers.auth]))

(helper! myapp.features.helpers.auth)

(defgiven "a user {name:string} with role {role:string}" auth/create-user!)
(defwhen  "the user logs in"                              auth/user-logs-in!)
(defthen  "the response status should be {status:int}"   auth/response-status)
```

### Helpers file — logic and assertions

```clojure
(ns myapp.features.helpers.auth
  (:require [gherclj.core :as g]
            [myapp.auth :as app]))

(defn create-user! [name role]
  (g/assoc! :user {:name name :role role}))

(defn user-logs-in! []
  (let [{:keys [role]} (g/get :user)]
    (g/assoc! :response (app/authenticate role))))

(defn response-status [expected]
  (g/should= expected (g/get-in [:response :status])))
```

## Step Types and Their Responsibilities

### defgiven — Set up preconditions

Given helpers mutate state to establish preconditions. No assertions needed.

### defwhen — Perform actions

When helpers perform the action under test. No assertions needed.

### defthen — Assert results

Then helpers MUST assert. A `defthen` helper that returns a value without asserting is a bug — it produces 0 assertions and silently passes.

If your project uses a single framework, you can use its native assertions directly (e.g., speclj's `should=`). Use `g/should=` when helpers need to be framework-agnostic — for example, when the project runs tests under both speclj and clojure.test.

```clojure
;; WRONG — no assertion, silently passes
(defn response-status [expected]
  (g/get-in [:response :status]))

;; RIGHT — asserts the expected value
(defn response-status [expected]
  (g/should= expected (g/get-in [:response :status])))
```

## Common Assertion Patterns

```clojure
;; Exact match
(g/should= expected (g/get :key))

;; Truthiness
(g/should (g/get :key))
(g/should-not (g/get :key))

;; Nil check
(g/should-be-nil (g/get :key))
(g/should-not-be-nil (g/get :key))

;; Collection
(g/should= expected-vec (g/get :items))
```

## State Management

Helpers use `gherclj.core` for state, aliased as `g`:

- `g/assoc!`, `g/assoc-in!` — set state
- `g/get`, `g/get-in` — read state
- `g/update!`, `g/update-in!` — modify state
- `g/swap!` — arbitrary state transformation
- `g/dissoc!` — remove state
- `g/reset!` — called automatically before each scenario

## Running Features and Scenarios

You can run a whole feature file by passing its path, or run a specific scenario by passing a `file:line` selector as a positional argument. A selector matches the scenario whose declaration contains the given line.

```bash
gherclj features/adventure/dragon_cave.feature

# Run one scenario from a feature
gherclj features/adventure/dragon_cave.feature:42

# Mix full-feature and single-scenario targets
gherclj features/adventure/dragon_cave.feature \
        features/adventure/moon_castle.feature:73
```

Feature paths and location selectors combine with normal options like `-f`, `-e`, `-o`, and tag filters.

## Discovering and Auditing Steps

```bash
# List all registered steps organized by Given/When/Then, with phrase, source location, and docstring
gherclj steps

# Check whether a phrase matches a registered step (reports match/no-match/ambiguous, with arg bindings)
gherclj match "the user logs in"

# Detect phrases in feature files that match multiple registered steps
gherclj ambiguity

# Find steps unused by any feature file (respects tag filters)
gherclj unused
```

Use `gherclj steps` to understand what steps already exist before writing new ones. Use `gherclj match` to verify a phrase routes to the intended step. Use `gherclj ambiguity` as a pre-flight check before running. Use `gherclj unused` during cleanup to find dead step definitions.

All four subcommands support `--json` and `--edn` for structured output.

## Verification

After implementing steps, always run the feature specs and verify:

1. **Assertion count > 0** — If you see `0 assertions`, your `defthen` helpers are not asserting
2. **No unexpected pending** — Pending scenarios mean step text isn't matching registered steps
3. **Real behavior is exercised** — Scenarios pass because the product implements the behavior, not because helpers simulated it
4. **Run:** `bb features` (or `bb test` for everything)

```
# Good — assertions present
40 examples, 0 failures, 68 assertions, 5 pending

# Bad — no assertions means defthen helpers aren't asserting
40 examples, 0 failures, 0 assertions, 5 pending
```

## Definition of Done

A feature implementation bead is NOT complete until:

1. **Step definition file exists** — `spec/<app>/features/steps/<feature>.clj`
2. **Helper file exists** — `spec/<app>/features/helpers/<feature>.clj`
3. **All scenarios run** — Remove the `@wip` tag from the feature file
4. **No pending scenarios** — Every scenario's step text matches a registered step
5. **Assertions > 0** — Every `defthen` helper asserts
6. **No fake behavior in helpers** — Helpers are not simulating missing product behavior
7. **All pass** — `bb features` shows 0 failures

Do NOT close a bead if the feature file still has `@wip`, if scenarios are pending, or if the feature only passes because the helpers fake missing behavior.
